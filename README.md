# EPyT-Flow -- EPANET Python Toolkit - Flow

EPyT-Flow is a Python package building on top of [EPyT](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/EPyT) 
for providing easy access to water distribution network simulations.
It aims to provide a high-level interface for the easy generation of hydraulic and water quality scenario data.
However, it also provides access to low-level functions by [EPANET](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/epanet) 
and [EPANET-MSX](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/epanet-msx).

EPyT-Flow provides easy access to popular benchmark data sets for event detection and localization.
Furthermore, it also provides an environment for developing and testing control algorithms.

## Installation

EPyT-Flow supports Python 3.9 - 3.12

### PyPI

```
pip install epyt-flow
```

### Git
Download or clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/WaterFutures/EPyT-Flow.git
cd EPyT-Flow
```

Install all requirements as listed in [REQUIREMENTS.txt](REQUIREMENTS.txt):
```
pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt
```

Install the toolbox:
```
pip install .
```

## Quick Example

```python
from epyt_flow.data.networks import load_hanoi
from epyt_flow.simulation import ScenarioSimulator
from epyt_flow.utils import to_seconds


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load Hanoi network
    network_config = load_hanoi()

    # Create scenario
    with ScenarioSimulator(scenario_config=network_config) as sim:
        # Set simulation duration to two days
        sim.set_general_parameters(simulation_duration=to_seconds(days=2))

        # Place pressure sensors at nodes "13", "16", "22", and "30"
        sim.set_pressure_sensors(sensor_locations=["13", "16", "22", "30"])

        # Place a flow sensor at link/pipe "1"
        sim.set_flow_sensors(sensor_locations=["1"])

        # Run entire simulation
        res = sim.run_simulation()

        # Show sensor readings over the entire simulation
        print(f"Pressure readings: {res.get_data_pressures()}")
        print(f"Flow readings: {res.get_data_flows()}")
```
