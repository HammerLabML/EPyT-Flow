# Summary

This work introduces `EPyT-Flow`, an open-source Python package building on top of the open-source package [EPyT](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/EPyT) 
for providing easy access to water distribution network (WDN) simulations.
EPyT-Flow aims to provide a high-level interface for the easy generation of hydraulic and water quality scenario data.
However, through EPyT it also provides access to low-level functions of the open-source packages [EPANET](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/epanet) 
and [EPANET-MSX](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/epanet-msx).
To accelerate and ease research, EPyT-Flow provides easy access to popular WDN benchmark data sets for event detection and localization, and also provides an environment for developing and testing control algorithms in WDNs.
