# Summary

This work introduces `EPyT-Flow`, an open-source Python package building on top of
[EPyT](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/EPyT) for providing easy access to
water distribution network (WDN) simulations.
Besides providing a high-level interface for the easy generation of hydraulic and
water quality scenario data, it also provides access to low-level functions
of [EPANET](https://github.com/USEPA/EPANET2.2) and
[EPANET-MSX](https://github.com/USEPA/EPANETMSX/).
To accelerate and ease research, `EPyT-Flow` also provides easy access to popular benchmark
data sets for event detection and localization, and also provides an environment for
developing and testing control algorithms.

# Statement of need 

Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) aim to ensure a reliable supply of drinking water, are operated
and monitored by humans, which are supported by software, such as basic control algorithms and event detectors,
relying on a few sensors in the WDN.
However, given the rapid growth of urban areas, WDNs are becoming more complex and key tasks such as
classic event detection and isolation (e.g. leakage detection), control tasks such as pump scheduling,
as well as modeling/prediction/forecasting of water quality states in WDNs, are becoming more challenging.
With increasing and time-varying uncertainty, traditional model-based methods are no longer sufficient,
and new AI and data-driven methods provide promising tools for tackling such challenges.
However, currently, non-water experts such as AI researchers face several challenges when
devising practical solutions for water system applications, such as the unavailability tools for
easy scenario/data generation and easy access to benchmarks, that hinder the progress of applying
AI to this domain. Easy-to-use toolboxes and access to benchmark data sets are extremely important
for boosting and accelerating research, as well as for supporting reproducible research, as it was,
for instance, the case in deep learning and machine learning where toolboxes such as
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
had a significant impact on boosting research.


## State of the field

The modeling and simulation of hydraulic and water quality dynamics in water distribution networks have
progressively advanced with the introduction of simulation software. Notably, `EPANET` [@rossman2000] and
its extension `EPANET-MSX` [@shang2008modeling] are foundational tools in this area. These are complemented
by tools that make use of high-level programming languages, such as the `EPANET-MATLAB Toolkit (EMT)` [@eliades2016],
the `Object-Oriented Pipe Network Analyzer (OOPNET)` [@Steffelbauer2015], and the
`EPANET-Python Toolkit (EPyT)` [@kyriakou2023epyt]. These tools are instrumental in facilitating research
into WDN resilience and response to various operational challenges. Moreover, `viswaternet` provides visualizations
of static and time-varying attributes of EPANET-based WDNs [@Thomas2023].

These tools, however, lack support for the creation of realistic (benchmark) scenarios by missing implementations
of essential aspects such as realistic fault models (of leakages and sensor faults), various sensor configurations,
custom control modules, and other events such as changes in water quality caused by external factors.
A first step towards such software for scenario creation is the `Water Network Tool for Resilience (WNTR)` [@klise2017software],
which facilitates the simulation of hydraulic dynamics, and in addition, it allows the simulation of various events
such as pipe breaks, disasters such as earthquakes, power outages, and fires. However, it currently does not support
quality dynamics and also misses other crucial aspects such as sensor configurations, and industrial control modules.

The transition to Python-based open-source software [@kyriakou2023epyt],[@klise2017software], underscores a broader trend
towards open-source, community-driven development in the water industry, aligning with the need for transparency,
reproducibility, and innovation in the sector.

# Functionality

Our Python toolbox `EPyT-Flow` provides a high-level interface for the easy generation of WDN scenario data,
but also provides access to low-level functions for maximum flexibility as needed by domain experts --
by this we aim to satisfy different needs and make it a toolbox for "everybody".
In addition, its design and object-orientated implementation makes it easy to customize existing
functionalities and implement new ones.
`EPyT-Flow` builds upon `EPyT` which itself provides a Python interface to `EPANET` 
and `EPANET-MSX` -- see Figure \ref{fig:toolbox:structure} for an illustration.

![Illustration of the functionality of the proposed toolbox *`EPyT-Flow`*.\label{fig:toolbox:structure}](figures/structure.drawio.png){ width=50% heigth=50%}

The toolbox currently includes $16$ Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) that can be used for scenario generation.
However, it also goes beyond pure scenario generation by providing access to $7$ popular and widely adopted
benchmarks on event detection and localization (incl. their evaluation metrics) -- ready to be
utilized for building and evaluating algorithms.
Furthermore, it also provides an environment (inspired by the former [OpenAI Gym](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html))
for developing and implementing control algorithms for tasks such as energy efficient pump scheduling.

In order to support modeling a wide variety of scenarios, the toolbox comes with $4$ different event types
and a total number of $13$ pre-defined and implemented events ready to be utilized in custom scenarios:
$3$ different leakages, $3$ actuator events, $5$ sensor faults, and $2$ communication events.
Furthermore, all those events can be easily customized as needed by the user.

Since the quantities in the real world are always subject to uncertainty, the toolbox comes with
$11$ pre-defined types of uncertainties ranging from classic Gaussian noise to different types of
(very) deep uncertainties that can be applied to hydraulic parameters such as pipe length, diameter,
and roughness, water quality parameters, such as reaction coefficients, and sensor noise.


More information can be found in the comprehensive ($190$+ pages) [documentation](https://epytflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and $14$ fully working examples that demonstrate how `EPyT-Flow` can be utilized in different tasks.

# Conclusions

In this work, we introduced a Python toolbox called `EPyT-Flow` for realistic scenario data generation and
access to benchmarks of WDNs, that researchers can utilize to develop methods to support human WDN operators
in various real-world challenges.

Our long-term vision for this toolbox is to split it into three parts to further facilitate the progress of research in this area:

1) A core part for data generation (i.e., scenario simulation);
2) A `BenchmarkHub` as a platform for accessing and sharing WDN benchmarks;
3) A `ModelHub` as a platform for accessing and sharing AI & classic models and algorithms for different tasks in WDNs.
