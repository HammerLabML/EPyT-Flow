+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

EPyT-Flow is a Python package building on top of `EPyT <https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/EPyT>`_ 
for providing easy access to water distribution network simulations.
It aims to provide a high-level interface for the easy generation of hydraulic and water quality scenario data.
However, it also provides access to low-level functions by `EPANET <https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/epanet>`_ 
and `EPANET-MSX <https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/epanet-msx>`_.

EPyT-Flow provides easy access to popular benchmark data sets for event detection and localization.
Furthermore, it also provides an evironment for developing and testing control algorithms.
